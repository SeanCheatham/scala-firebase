A collection of libraries for using Firebase in Scala

This is a work-in-progress and has not yet been published.  You are free to fork and do as you please in the meantime.

# Overview

Use this library to leverage Akka Streams combined with Firebase.  This library provides Sources, Sinks, and Flows to be
dropped inside of your application.

# Usage
This library is written in Scala.  It _might_ interoperate with other JVM languages, but I make no guarantees.

This library uses Typesafe's Play JSON library for serialization of content.
